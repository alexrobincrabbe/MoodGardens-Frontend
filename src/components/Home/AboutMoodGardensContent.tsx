          Mood Gardens turns your feelings into symbolic little worlds -
          reflective spaces that mirror your inner self. Each garden is like a
          page from your soul journal, capturing your emotions and the shape of
          each day. They are moments to hold onto, pauses in time, saved for you
          to return to whenever you need them.

          Your journal entries belong only to you - completely private and
          unseen by anyone else. If you’d like to share a Mood Garden picture
          with friends (no writing will be shown, your words are always yours
          alone) simply tap the share button and choose who and where.
